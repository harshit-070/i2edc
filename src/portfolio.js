      Any new product or service cannot be termed as mechanical or electrical or software etc. The purpose of a product or service is to solve a problem and almost always it involves multi-disciplinary effort across departments.
      I2EDC is your go to place for converting your ideas into solutions. I2EDC will endeavor to help you create a multi-disciplinary team, mentor you through our internal and external experts and provide you the resources.
      Through the establishment of the Tinkerer‚Äôs lab, which will be run by the students themselves , we wish to inculcate the practice of doing things with your own hands.
      I do hope that you participate actively in the I2EDC activities and become a better and creative hands-on engineer.

An innovation is something original, new, and important in whatever field that breaks into (or obtains a foothold in) a market or society. IIT Jammu seriously considered the formal inclusion of this activity into the academics and research initiatives covering as wide a cross-section of faculty and students as possible. The institutionalisation of this process and its sustenance is a multipronged effort to create a core centre, the "I2EDC". This core centre, the I2EDC supports innovation, pre-incubation and entrepreneurship for students and faculty members. 

      I2EDC aspires to be a fully integrated platform for students, staff and faculty members of IIT Jammu to actively engage them in innovation and entrepreneurship-related activities. The I2EDC inculcates the culture of entrepreneurship at the institute level, as entrepreneurial mindset is distinct from academic mindset and also the main objective of I2EDC is to develop processes and systems to effectively utilize available resources to develop an ecosystem of Innovation leading to entrepreneurship.
      
      I invite all of you to use the I2EDC facility at its best level for ideation and innovation.
